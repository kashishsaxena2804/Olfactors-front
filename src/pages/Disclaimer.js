      <h2>Disclaimer: Olfactors Natural Perfume User</h2>
      <p>Before using Olfactors Natural Luxury Perfume, please take a moment to carefully review the following disclaimer.</p>
      
      <h2>Application on Pulse Points:</h2>
      <p>Apply the fragrance to your pulse points, where blood vessels are close to the skin's surface, allowing the scent to disperse effectively. Typical pulse points include the wrists, inner elbows, neck, area behind the ears, and below the throat.</p>

      <h2>Spray Distance for Natural Perfume:</h2>
      <p>Apply the fragrance to your pulse points, where blood vessels are close to the skin's surface, allowing the scent to disperse effectively. Typical pulse points include the wrists, inner elbows, neck, area behind the ears, and below the throat.</p>

      <h2>Individual Variation in Fragrance Reaction:</h2>
      <p>Reactions to perfumes may vary due to individual body chemistry and preferences. Natural perfumes may develop unique aromas and vary in longevity based on individual characteristics. Please consider these differences when using natural scents.</p>

      <h2>Fragrance Intensity and Reapplication:</h2>
      <p>Natural perfumes may have a more subtle and elusive scent compared to synthetic fragrances. Reapplication throughout the day may be necessary to maintain the desired aroma due to natural ingredients' shorter longevity.</p>

      <h2>Ingredient Sourcing and Variability:</h2>
      <p>Botanical materials used in natural perfumes are subject to sourcing variations due to factors such as seasonal availability and sustainability concerns. As a result, there may be changes in aroma or composition over time.</p>

      <h2>Storage and Shelf Life:</h2>
      <p>To preserve the quality of natural perfumes, store them in a dark, cool, and dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Natural perfumes may have a shorter shelf life compared to synthetic fragrances, so it is advisable to use them within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

      <h2>External Use Only:</h2>
      <p>Natural perfumes are intended for external use only and should not be ingested or applied to damaged or inflamed skin. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes, and wash skin thoroughly with water if contact occurs.</p>

      <h2>Avoid Rubbing:</h2>
      <p>To maintain the fragrance's integrity, avoid rubbing wrists together after application, as this may alter the scent's molecular structure. Allow the perfume to dry naturally on the skin for optimal results.</p>
